A field in a Word document is a special type of object used to insert dynamic content into a document, such as the current date, page number, or a even piece of information from a database. Fields can be updated automatically by Word, and their contents can change depending on the context in which they are used. There are several types of fields, each with its own specific purpose: date field, page field, TOC field, cross-reference field, index field, Mail Merge field, etc. Fields can be programmatically inserted into a document and then updated to reflect the actual information.
Aspose.Words REST API allows developers to work with fields in Word documents. The API includes several related methods:
