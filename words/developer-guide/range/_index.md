A Range in a Word document is a continuous sequence of text or a group of elements such as paragraphs, tables, and images. Ranges are used to indicate the part of the document on which you want to apply a particular operation, such as inserting new content or manipulating existing content. For example, you can use a Range to format text, insert a table, or apply styles to a portion of a document.

The Range object has several properties, including: the text contained in the range, the starting and ending positions, the length in characters, and others.

Aspose.Words REST API provides a set of functions to work with Ranges, making it easy to manipulate Word documents programmatically.
