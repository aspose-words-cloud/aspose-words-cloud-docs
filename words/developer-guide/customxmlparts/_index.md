With the release of Office 2007, Microsoft introduced developers to a new XML-based format for representing office documents â€” Open Office XML or OOXML for short. DOCX, XLSX and PPTX are well-known representatives of the OOXML format that underlies them.

OOXML quickly gained popularity as it allowed programmers to easily manipulate document data, as well as perform data integration with third-party software. Compared to previous binary office formats such as DOC, XLS, PPT, the new document format provided greater security and greater resistance to data corruption.


## What are 'Custom XML Parts'

'Custom XML Parts' is external arbitrary data embedded in a Word document. Once you've embedded XML in a document, you can bind it to a content control to visualize it. If you introduce changes to the data displayed on the content control, this will automatically lead to changes in the source XML data.
 
Programmatically, custom XML is a collection of XML data. You can create new data elements, modify or delete existing ones:

- [Get Custom XML Parts](/words/customxmlparts/get-all/)
- [Get Custom XML Part](/words/customxmlparts/get/)
- [Insert Custom XML Part](/words/customxmlparts/insert/)
- [Update Custom XML Part](/words/customxmlparts/update/)
- [Delete Custom XML Parts](/words/customxmlparts/delete-all/)
- [Delete Custom XML Part](/words/customxmlparts/delete/)
