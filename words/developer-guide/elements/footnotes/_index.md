A footnote is a reference or additional information that appears at the bottom of a page, usually indicated by a superscript number or symbol. Footnotes are used to provide additional information or clarification about a specific point in the text without interrupting the flow of the main text. They are often used in academic or research papers, legal documents, and other forms of professional writing.

Aspose.Words REST API provides several functions for working with footnotes in Word documents, such as adding, modifying, extracting, removing and formatting footnotes. This allows developers to easily manipulate footnotes in Word documents.
