A bookmark is a named location in a Word document that allows user to quickly navigate to a specific section or text within the document. A bookmark is defined by a name and a range of text that it marks.

The name of a bookmark is a unique identifier that is used to reference the bookmark within the document. When creating a bookmark, you can assign it a name, and then you can use that name to perform operations on the associated text.

Aspose.Words REST API allows developers to manipulate bookmarks programmatically. The API includes several related methods:


{{<list-children-pages>}}
