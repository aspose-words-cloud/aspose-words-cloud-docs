A `FormField` is a type of field that can be used to input or display information, such as text, dates, and numbers. Formfields are often used to create forms and templates, such as legal documents, invoices, and surveys. They are typically represented by a blank space in the document that can be filled in by the user, and can have various properties such as format and validation.

Aspose.Words REST API provides several functions for working with formfields in Word documents, such as adding, modifying, extracting, removing and formatting formfields. This allows developers to easily manipulate formfields in Word documents.
