This REST API retrieves `Document` information.

The API returns a JSON/XML representation of the document unless a specific Accept header is provided in which case it will return the document in the specified format. The different representations of a document are basically the formats to which the document can be converted. So to achieve a conversion, all a user has to do is to use one of these links.
