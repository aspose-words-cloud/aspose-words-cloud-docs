Aspose.Words Cloud supports [text and document classification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document_classification) into the [Interactive Advertising Bureau (IAB) taxonomy](https://www.iab.com/guidelines/taxonomy/) categories. Document classification is often used in various business processes to automate the flow of documents through the organization.

Text classification is a lightweight version of classification API that processes text snippets. You do not need to store the snippet on any storage, instead, it is supplied in the request body.
