Aspose.Words Cloud is a service to programmatically manipulate documents in different file formats such as DOCX, HTML, PDF, DOC, JPG, and others. With Aspose.Words API, you can easily create, open, edit, convert, and save your documents. For example, you can find and replace text in Word documents, or insert a table of contents into your document, or load DOCX and convert it to PDF format.

Aspose.Words Cloud API takes care of low-level details to make requests and handle responses. And this lets you focus on writing code specific to your particular project.
